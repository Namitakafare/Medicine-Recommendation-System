# Installation
Prerequisites

1.Python 3.x

2.Streamlit

3.Pandas

4.Pickle

# Steps to Open Localhost for application: 🌐
>1.Extract pickle-files.rar it will extract "similarity.pkl" & "medicine_dict.pkl" pickle files. Make sure the files should be present in the root directory where the app.py is present.
>
>2.Download VSCode/Pycharm IDE and Open this application folder in it.
>
>3.Open Termial.
>
>4.Import Libraries: streamlit, pandas and pickle.
>
>5.Type- streamlit run app.py
>
>6.if the application does not start then type python -m streamlit run app.py
# Development Setup
1.IDE Setup: Download VSCode/PyCharm IDE and open the project folder in it.

2.Terminal Commands: Use the terminal in VSCode/PyCharm to run the above commands.

# Deployment and Data Files 📦
To facilitate deployment and address GitHub's file size limit of 100 MB, we have reduced the size of the similarity.pkl file. However, the original data files required for the application are available in the pickle-files.rar archive.

Here's how to handle the deployment and retrieve the original data files:

Reduced similarity.pkl File: The reduced similarity.pkl file is provided in the root directory of this repository. This file is optimized for deployment and may contain a smaller subset of data. It is suitable for running the application in a production environment.

# Original Data Files: 
To obtain the original data files used for development and testing,you will need to extract them from the pickle-files.rar archive .These files.similarity.pkl and medicine_dict.pkl, should be placed in the same directory as the application script app.py for full fuctionality.
